# GPT-SWE

GPT-SWE is a command line tool that assists you in managing your software engineering tasks, leveraging the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT models.

The 'apply changes' feature can create/update/delete files on your system. Use at your own risk. At the very least you should `git commit` anything you want to save before using this feature.

Feel free to submit PRs. Any improvements are appreciated.

## Features

- Interact with ChatGPT to:
  - Ask questions about your code
  - Implement new features
  - Fix bugs
  - Clean up and refactor your code
  - Write tests
  - Find potential bugs
  - Perform code reviews
  - etc.

- Automatically apply changes directly to your project files and let ChatGPT do all of your work. Dangerous and fun!

## Requirements

- An OpenAI API key with access to ChatGPT models.
